I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.

I came up with the idea behind Ethereum. This idea of a blockchain with a built-in programming language as, kind of, what I thought was the simplest and kind of most logical way to actually build a platform that can be used for many more kinds of applications.

Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.

If crypto succeeds, it's not because it empowers better people, it's because to empowers better institutions.

Bitcoin is great as a form of digital money, but its scripting language is too weak for any kind of serious advanced applications to be built on top.

The industrial revolution allowed us, for the first time, to start replacing human labour with machines.

If World of Warcraft moves onto Ethereum, I'll consider playing again.

I remember knowing, for a while, for a long time, that I was kind of abnormal in some sense.

When I came up with Ethereum, my first thought was, "Okay, this thing is too good to be true." As it turned out, the core Ethereum idea was good â€“ fundamentally, completely sound.

The thing that I often ask startups on top of Ethereum is, "Can you please tell me why using the Ethereum blockchain is better than using Excel?" And if they can come up with a good answer, that's when you know you've got something really interesting.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are doing different things. Bitcoin is a digital currency, and the protocol is written to sustain this cryptocurrency. Clearly, Ethereum platform has ETH, it is also a digital currency, but it exists to sustain the protocol.

The main advantage of blockchain technology is supposed to be that it's more secure, but new technologies are generally hard for people to trust, and this paradox can't really be avoided.

In order to have a decentralised database, you need to have security. In order to have security, you need to have incentives.

In general, signalling theory says that if you have a good way of proving something and a noisy way of proving something, and you choose the noisy way, that means chances are it's because you couldn't do the good way in the first place.

Some bitcoin users see the hard fork as in some ways violating their most fundamental values. I personally think these fundamental values, pushed to such extremes, are silly.

I personally like hard forks. Particularly, I like the fact that they give users a measure of control, requiring them to opt in to protocol changes. Sure, they can be a little more chaotic if they're controversial, but that's the price of freedom.

Normalize saying "dub" (instead of "double-yoo") as the name of the letter W. All letters deserve a one-syllable name.

Anti-malaria, pandemic response, mitigating extreme poverty, life extension research, mitigating existential risks (including AI) and thinking about the multimillion-year future of humanity are all very important and undervalued issues and will continue to be for quite a while.

People whose primary vibe is "I and my tribe are domain-expertise-endowed professionals, the people I criticize and mock are amateurs, and you should shut up" are really really uncool, and people should recognize the pattern and immediately unfollow anyone who exhibits it.

Beware the impulse to preach that "we must make sacrifices for the sake of peace" but suggest only sacrifices where other people are the ones sacrificing while you give up nothing.

One of my minor gripes with many mainstream media publications is how unwilling they are to link directly to primary sources. Often I have to go through many different articles and search keywords to find the original document. Linking to the primary source should be the norm!

My concern with VR is similar to some anti-crypto people's concern about crypto: a feeling that people are "in love with the idea of it" in a way that far outpaces actual applications. Just like with crypto, I do think important apps exist! But "VR for the sake of VR" won't work.

So I guess we still haven't figured out how not to give large-scale murderers and thieves unlimited opportunity to become the primary topic of public conversation... We really need better edgelords.

One thing that people don't appreciate enough about land taxes (and even property taxes) is that the existence of the tax means the property is much cheaper for you to acquire in the first place. You can put the difference into stocks and pay the tax out of the price gains.

Random fantasy novel idea: make a world where humans are one-dimensionalized and stereotyped the same way we treat orcs and elves today. Like, there should only be one Human Nation, with one personality trait, and its capital should be called Humanton (and the main food hummus).

The less libertarian side of me sometimes kinda wishes that the EU would make it illegal to make iOS-only apps, and require companies of a certain size to either write a version for each major platform or use a cross-platform dev framework.

I propose the term "alfalfa leak" for something that doesn't give you an easy path to short term profit, but is still ultimately good for you.

Being a pluralist requires being at peace with the fact that there are groups in the world that operate under principles very alien and uncongenial to you, and that some of those groups even have some power.

Reminder: Ethereum is neutral, but I am not.

Freedom is important.

People continue to underrate how often cryptocurrency payments are superior not even because of censorship resistance but just because they're so much more convenient. Big boost to international business and charity, and sometimes even payments within countries.

Paradox of diversity: if every organization within society must fully reflect the diversity of that society's members, then there can be no diversity _between_ organizations in that society.

The "metaverse" is going to happen but I don't think any of the existing corporate attempts to intentionally create the metaverse are going anywhere.

Am I the only one who finds genetic enhancement of humans _much more palatable_ than brain implants? Genes are hard to target; there's no "gene for obedience to the communist party". But mixing brains and centralized digital tech risks eroding our strongest domain of privacy.

The filtering and quality control functions that are done by centralized services are essential, even though centralized actors having a chokehold on those functions is very dangerous. We need more work on decentralized reputation systems to try to get the best of both worlds.

Is it necessarily a bad thing if a protocol optimizes a little bit for being theatrical? (Thinking about Bitcoin's sudden halvings every 4 years, as opposed to the smooth exponential decay curve that a mathematician would have made)

They should just rename W from "double-yoo" to "wee".

Sometimes the real scarce resource is legitimacy.

No, I'm not giving away ETH.

The only correct order for dates is: year, month, day (eg. 2018 Apr 17, or 2018.04.17). All other orders are an abomination.

I've decided I'm more okay than before with taking risks with my social capital and occasionally having enemies.

I think we should genetically engineer our children so that their brains have hash and elliptic curve operation precompiles.

Buterin's Law: any "principle", "rule" or "law" which the creator deliberately tries to name after themselves and promote and market with their own name will not gain traction and probably doesn't deserve to.

Reminder: the correct resolution to the "can an omnipotent god make a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?" paradox is: yes, he can, but as soon as the rock is created he will no longer be omnipotent, he'll be 'omnipotent except for that darn rock'

The slippery slope fallacy fallacy: assuming that all slippery slope arguments are fallacious.

So total cryptocoin market cap just hit $0.5T today. But have we _earned_ it?

So I just misspelled the name of someone named Jason as "Json".

My centrist blockchain governance philosophy in a nutshell: I supported the DAO fork. I support things like the DAO fork being _hard_.

Asian fusion: my favorite Western cuisine.

Two eyes for an eye will make the whole world blind in O(log(n)) time.

Remember that section in the game theory textbook that talks about how being credibly insane can actually give you a strategic advantage?

Doge is E-God spelled backwards.
